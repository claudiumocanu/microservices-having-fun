### Sometimes I'm lonely...  
- frontend in angular
- most of the backend components in golang
- maybe add some node, java, python for fun larter on
- rabbitMQ for communication between some of the microservices
- a relational DB, maybe postgres
- mongo to perist some messages
- will see if will make sense to add a redis instance as well
